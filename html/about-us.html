        <h1>About Amanda B Cormer and her philosophy</h1>
        <article>
            <p>Hi, my name is Amanda B Cormer and I'm the owner of ABC Opticals, and I'd like to briefly 
                introduce you to who we are. I'm an optometrist with 20 years’ experience, having worked 
                for independents and chain stores both here and in London. It was in London that I 
                gravitated to the groovy, high end of the market and returned to Brisbane 9 years ago 
                with a new concept. 
                <br><br>
                Over years of working for others, what struck me was either mediocre eyewear, outdated 
                testing equipment in the back room, or both. ABC Opticals brings together the world’s finest 
                and funkiest eyewear designers, coupled with state of the art equipment to make the eye 
                examination a very civilised affair. 
                <br><br>
                We enjoy selling quality products, and most importantly, we enjoy finding the right frame 
                for the right person. That's what we do and we do it well. We don't sell eyewear over the 
                net, so visit us in person. We're worth the effort and your eyes should be too. Finally, we 
                believe that children should be treated as special people so all our staff will make the 
                experience at ABC Opticals the best we can for your child.
